<p2>I am Rayes Gallegos, a Cibola high school graduate and soon to be college graduate at the University of New Mexico with a degree in Multimedia Journalism. As a kid I wanted to be a professional athlete but in high school I realized I didn't have the physical traits to play against athletes who were twice my size. I tried out for the basketball team twice but unfortunately didn't make the team. I was heartbroken because my dreams weren't going to come to fruition, but I loved sports too much to just let it go. So, I decided to pursue a career path as a sports analyst, broadcaster or writer. As of today, here I am on the verge of pursuing dream number two. Just because I call it dream number two doesn't mean I don't have the same passion for it as dream number one. When I eventually become a sports analyst, broadcaster or writer I hope to provide a new form of analysis that informs the audience on detailed aspects of sports that includes analytics, data and honing in on a players specific traits. As well as what traits an athlete needs to be successful in the professional field. A new form of media that dives into the x's and o's as opposed to a simplistic view. 
Aside from sports I love to spend time with my family and newborn puppy. It's amazing how cathartic a puppy can be and how they can drastically change your life for the better. I  also love long car rides and road trips. On road trips I love to listen to music and watch the trees, mountains and houses. I love to explore around the world and visit the different cities in America.</p2>
