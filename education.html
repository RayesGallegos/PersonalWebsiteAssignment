Hello All,
<br><br>
I graduated Cibola high school in 2019 with a 3.2 grade point average. During my tenure at Cibola high school I joined DECA and went to state in 2017 and 2018 in accounting and business management. I also was an academic scholar and a nominee for the National Honor Society. In middle school I went to the National Science Fair and was a part of the National Honor Society. In college at the University of New Mexico I was nominated to join the National Honor Society and The National Society of Leadership and Success. During my tenure at the University of New Mexico I maintained a 3.9 grade point average or higher for all four years. I also am an editor intern at the New Mexico News Port where previously I was a reporter and had several articles published. Early in my academic career at UNM I was a sports reporter at the Daily Lobo for a semester. I also didn't receive a grade below a B minus at the University of New Mexico. For three semesters in a row I received a 4.0 grade point average.
